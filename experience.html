                        <p>     When choosing a career, I believe one must choose the lifestyle they desire and then pick a career that will 
                            help them achieve those goals. My number one priority is being able to create opportunities for my family to
                            spend time together, progress, and be happy. In preparation for this program, I have taken an internship at 
                            Acquire Med, a local medical device sales company. This position has taught me how to create and organize
                            financial statements. I built a trusting relationship with my employer prior to my internship which has allowed
                            me to have opportunities I could not have had elsewhere. 
                        </p>
                        <p>     In addition to my internship, I participated in a 
                            global business study abroad in Latin America visiting different business entities in the host countries of 
                            Brazil, Peru, and Costa Rica such as Walmart, Petrobras, and the US Commercial Service. I also attended many 
                            of the finance society meetings hosted by Brigham Young University, giving me great exposure to excel software, different specialties within finance, 
                            and opportunities to network with teachers and students within the program.

                                I have had many leadership opportunities throughout my life. One unique opportunity I had in particular was being
                            the president of a summer camp for youth boys ages 16-18 the summer after I graduated high school. I led a three-day
                            camp with about 80 young men in attendance, directing activities that prepared them for creating a good life through study, work, and
                            service. Preparation for this camp included six months of weekly meetings to plan how we would manage and facilitate
                            the camp. This experience helped me develop skills in effective planning, management, and meaningful facilitation of uplifting activities.â€¯
